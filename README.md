# Nim Game - Choose Your Challenge!

## About
This is a web-based implementation of the Nim game where two players take turns incrementing a number by either 1 or 2. The goal is to be the player who reaches the number 20 first.

I created this application just to win as a party trick! With the minimax algorithm in place, the computer will never lose, whether it plays first or second.

## Game Modes
You can choose who starts the game:
1. **Player Starts First**: Test your skills against the computer by going first.
2. **Computer Starts First**: Let the computer take the lead and try to catch up!

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Choose who will start first by selecting the appropriate button.
3. The game starts at 0. You can choose to add either 1 or 2 to the current number on your turn.
4. The goal is to be the player who reaches 20 first.
5. The computer will automatically take its turn after you or start the game, depending on the mode. It is unbeatable!

## How It Works
The game uses a minimax algorithm to ensure that the computer always plays optimally. This means the computer will never lose, making it a fun challenge for your friends at parties!

## Enjoy Winning!
Have fun and enjoy impressing your friends with your unbeatable party trick!
